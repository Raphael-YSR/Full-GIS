Add shapefiles of counties

add new toggle on/off default off for showing counties,
 counties have a shade of blue getting lighter as we move to the right.

The county select filter should also filter the county shapefiles displayed in the map, as well as the points as they do now.




STEPS

add new table, county_shp store their coordinates using postgis
link it to the existing county table
